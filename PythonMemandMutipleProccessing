you have to sidestep the Global Interpreter Lock. In Python, instead of using threads, you can use multiprocessing.

It is possible to share data between processes. You can read about this here.
Getting started with multiprocessing is easy, here are a few resources:
Python 201: A multiprocessing tutorial
Python Multiprocess Tutorial: Run Code in Parallel Using the Multiprocessing Module — Corey Shafer’s youtube video that contains an example of image processing.
Dead Simple Example of Using Multiprocessing Queue, Pool, and Locking — Stackoverflow thread.
The one thing you have to remember with multiprocessing is that the entire memory is copied into a subprocess. That’s why memory profiling is important.
